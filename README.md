## AWS Flow Overview: ‚òÅÔ∏è
1. Customer sends request to API;

2. API:
* Performs operations with the database;
* Post in SNS topic (only when some product or category is created or updated for now);

3. SNS topic send the message to SQS (so messages can be handled asynchronously, on a queue);

3. SQS send to Lambda (serverless function);

4. Lambda is triggered when a message arrives in SQS, and save/update on S3;

5. S3 bucket (to store the JSON of the products/categories).
